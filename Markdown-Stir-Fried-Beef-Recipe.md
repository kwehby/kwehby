# Stir-Fried Beef

***Makes 2 servings***

**Ingredients**
3/4 cup water
3 tablespoons soy sauce
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1 tablespoon honey
1/4 teaspoon minced fresh ginger
1 tablespoon sesame oil
1 pound flank steak, sliced into 1/2-inch strips
1 cup half-moon sliced carrot (from 1 large carrot)
1 cup chopped broccoli florets (from 1 broccoli head)
1 cup fresh sweet yellow corn (from 1 ear cob)
Cooked noodles or rice, for serving

**Directions**
1. Whisk together the water, soy sauce, cornstarch, honey, and ginger in a small bowl. Set aside.
2. Heat the sesame oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until the oil shimmers. Add the sliced beef. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the beef is cooked through and no longer pink, about 3 minutes. Remove the beef from the skillet. Do not wipe the skillet clean.
3. Add the carrot, broccoli, and corn to the skillet. Cook over medium-high heat, stirring often, until the vegetables are tender-crisp, about 3 minutes.
4. Return the beef to the vegetable mixture in the skillet. Pour in the soy sauce mixture, and cook over medium-high heat, stirring often, until the sauce thickens and evenly coats the mixture, about 2 minutes.
5. Serve with cooked noodles or rice.
